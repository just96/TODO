# TODO List App

A simple **web-based TODO List** built with **vanilla JavaScript** that allows you to manage tasks, edit them, and track their creation time. Tasks are saved in **localStorage**, so they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete individual tasks
- Clear all tasks
- Real-time clock display
- Task creation timestamps
- Alerts for duplicates, empty tasks, or cleared list
- Persistent storage with `localStorage`

## Technologies

- HTML / CSS (Bootstrap 5)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Bootstrap Icons

## Concepts Applied

- **DOM Manipulation** – dynamically update the task list and buttons
- **Event Listeners** – handle user interactions like clicks and keypresses
- **LocalStorage** – store tasks and timestamps to persist data
- **Date & Time Formatting** – display creation dates in readable format
- **Alert Handling** – show notifications for invalid actions
